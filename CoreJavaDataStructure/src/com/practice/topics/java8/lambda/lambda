
 - In lambda expressions a piece of code becomes the value of the variable and wherever that variable is used 
   the values goes with it.
   
  - All that is required to create a lambda expression is a matching method signature from an interface .
  - Lambda behaves like an implementation of an interface.
  
  Why Lambdas
   - It enables functional programming
   - Readable and concise code.
   - Easier to use API
   - Enables support for parallel processing
